<h3>About</h3>

<p>
  "Generation E" is a cross-border data journalism project. We want to understand and show a generation of young European women and men who are leaving their southern European countries. Why do they leave their countries? Where do they go? What do they do now?
</p>

<p>More and more people are leaving countries like Portugal, Spain, Italy and Greece. Some are driven by the hardships of the financial crisis, some just want to study abroad and stay, others are driven by sentimental reasons. You are one of these people? We want to tell your story. Fill out our survey, share our project. Let's make Generation E visible.</p>
